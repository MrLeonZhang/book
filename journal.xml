                    I have encountered many ads recently, most notably on Youtube shorts, aiming to deal with people's sense of dissatisfaction in their lives.
                    My opinion of these ads has always been that they are ridiculous services for ridiculous people who are a product of these shitty times.
                    Social media companies constantly try to push their profit margins by making people using their services feel special, heard, and deeply connected to the communities around them.
                    But how far can you push this without becoming delusional? Not very far in my opinion. So many believe in this delusion pushed by social media and may not even realise it.
                    Look, these services like Liven may be good for some but I look at these ads and think if you are someone who needs this, why not try questioning your understanding of suffering?
                    What is your relationship to suffering? Do you feel like you deserve to feel unpleasant emotions? Expose this modern myth of perfection that the social media companies try so hard to push.
                    To be free is hardly a physical state, it's mostly a mental exercise. No one can be free if they are, say, afraid of embarrassing themselves.
                    Yet even myself in my moments of weakness find myself running from embarrassment, acting completely out of fear. But at least I'm working on conquering that fear.
                    Woe to those that do not find themselves even on this path.
                    "Life is shit. I don't deserve this." The irony, there in that statement, lies the source of the suffering.
